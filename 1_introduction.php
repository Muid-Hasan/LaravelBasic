// Hello and welcome to an introductory lesson on Laravel! Laravel is a popular PHP web framework that makes it easier for developers to create web applications by following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Laravel offers a clean and elegant syntax, making it a joy to work with.

// First, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

// PHP >= 7.3
// Composer (a dependency management tool for PHP)
// Once you have the prerequisites, you can install Laravel using Composer. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:


// composer global require laravel/installer
// This will install the Laravel installer globally on your system. Now, you can create a new Laravel project using the following command:


// laravel new project-name
// Replace "project-name" with the desired name for your project. This will create a new folder with the project files in it.

// Now, let's cover some basic concepts in Laravel:

// Routes: Routes define the URLs of your application and map them to a specific function or method in a controller. In Laravel, you can define routes in the routes/web.php file. For example, to create a route for the homepage:

// Route::get('/', function () {
//     return view('welcome');
// });
// Controllers: Controllers are responsible for handling user requests and returning a response. To create a controller, run the following command:

// php artisan make:controller ControllerName
// Replace "ControllerName" with the desired name for your controller.

// Models: Models represent the data structure of your application and are used to interact with the database. To create a model, run the following command:

// php artisan make:model ModelName -m
// Replace "ModelName" with the desired name for your model. The -m flag creates a migration file for the model.

// Views: Views are the templates that render the HTML of your application. Laravel uses the Blade templating engine, which allows you to write clean and easy-to-read templates. Views are stored in the resources/views directory.

// Migrations: Migrations are like version control for your database. They allow you to modify your database schema in a structured and organized way. Migrations are stored in the database/migrations directory.

// Artisan: Laravel includes a command-line tool called Artisan, which provides useful commands for common tasks. To see a list of available commands, run:


// php artisan list

// This should give you a basic understanding of Laravel and its structure. As you continue to learn and work with Laravel, you will encounter more advanced features and concepts, such as Eloquent ORM, Middleware, Service Providers, and more. There are numerous resources available online to help you deepen your understanding and improve your skills with Laravel.
