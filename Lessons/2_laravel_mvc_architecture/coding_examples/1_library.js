// present a scenario of a simple web application to design an MVC - based architecture for their application, including the models, views, and controllers needed

// Sure, let's say we want to build a simple web application for a library, where users can view the available books, borrow books, and return books. Here's how we can design the MVC - based architecture for this application:

//     Models
// We'll need two models: Book and User. The Book model will represent the books available in the library, while the User model will represent the users who borrow and return the books. Here's what the models might look like:


//     <? php

// namespace App;

// use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

// class Book extends Model {
//     protected $fillable = ['title', 'author', 'isbn', 'published_year', 'available'];

//     public function users() {
//         return $this -> belongsToMany(User:: class) -> withPivot('borrowed_at', 'returned_at');
//     }
// }


//     <? php

// namespace App;

// use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

// class User extends Model {
//     protected $fillable = ['name', 'email'];

//     public function books() {
//         return $this -> belongsToMany(Book:: class) -> withPivot('borrowed_at', 'returned_at');
//     }
// }

// Note that we've defined a many-to-many relationship between the Book and User models using the belongsToMany() method. This is because each user can borrow multiple books, and each book can be borrowed by multiple users. We've also included a withPivot() method to specify the additional fields we'll need in the pivot table (which we'll create later).

// Views
// We'll need several views for this application:

// A view to display the list of available books.
// A view to display the details of a single book.
// A view to display the list of borrowed books for a specific user.
// A view to allow a user to borrow a book.
// A view to allow a user to return a book.
//     Here's an example of what the view to display the list of available books might look like (books/index.blade.php):



// @extends ('layouts.app')

// @section('content')
//     <h1>Available Books</h1>

//     <ul>
//         @foreach ($books as $book)
//             <li>
//                 <a href="{{ route('books.show', $book->id) }}">{{ $book->title }} by {{ $book->author }}</a>
//                 ({{ $book->available ? 'Available' : 'Not Available' }})
//             </li>
//         @endforeach
//     </ul>
// @endsection



// Controllers
// We'll need several controllers for this application as well:

// A controller to handle the list of available books.
// A controller to handle the details of a single book.
// A controller to handle the list of borrowed books for a specific user.
// A controller to handle the borrowing of a book.
// A controller to handle the returning of a book.
//     Here's what the controller to handle the list of available books might look like (BookController.php):


//     <? php

// namespace App\Http\Controllers;

// use App\Book;
// use Illuminate\Http\Request;

// class BookController extends Controller {
//     public function index() {
//         $books = Book:: where('available', true) -> get();

//         return view('books.index', compact('books'));
//     }

//     public function show(Book $book) {
//         return view('books.show', compact('book'));
//     }
// }


// In this example, we've defined two methods: index() and show(). The index() method retrieves a list of available books from the database (i.e., books where the available field is true) using the where() method on the `

// Sure, in the index() method on the BookController, we've also passed the retrieved list of books to the index.blade.php view using the compact() function. Similarly, in the show() method, we've passed a single book object to the show.blade.php view using the compact() function.
