Explain Eloquent  orm in laravel with code example 
Eloquent is Laravel's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, which provides an easy way to work with databases using PHP objects instead of raw SQL. Eloquent is built on top of the PHP PDO library, which provides a simple and secure way to interact with databases.

Here is an example of how to use Eloquent to create a model for a "users" table and perform some basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:

Define a "users" table in your database with columns for "id", "name", "email", and "password".

Create a new model for the "users" table using the php artisan make:model command:

php
Copy code
php artisan make:model User
Define the properties and methods for the User model. Eloquent will automatically map these properties to the corresponding columns in the database table:
php
Copy code
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'password'];
}
In this example, we have defined a model for the "users" table with three properties: "name", "email", and "password". The $fillable array specifies which properties can be set using mass assignment.

Create a new user:
php
Copy code
$user = new User;
$user->name = 'John Doe';
$user->email = 'john.doe@example.com';
$user->password = bcrypt('password123');
$user->save();
In this example, we have created a new user by creating a new instance of the User model, setting its properties, and calling the save() method to save it to the database.

Retrieve a user:
php
Copy code
$user = User::find(1);
In this example, we have retrieved a user with the id of 1 using the find() method.

Update a user:
php
Copy code
$user = User::find(1);
$user->name = 'Jane Doe';
$user->save();
In this example, we have updated the name of a user with the id of 1.

Delete a user:
php
Copy code
$user = User::find(1);
$user->delete();
In this example, we have deleted a user with the id of 1 using the delete() method.

Overall, Eloquent makes it easy to work with databases in Laravel by providing a simple and intuitive API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data using PHP objects.

Sure, here are some more details about the key features of Eloquent ORM in Laravel:

Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture: Eloquent is designed to work seamlessly with Laravel's MVC architecture. In this architecture, the application's data is managed by a set of models, which represent the data and the relationships between the data. The views are responsible for presenting the data to the user, while the controllers are responsible for managing the user's interactions with the data.

Database migration: Database migration is a key feature of Laravel that allows you to manage the schema of your database using PHP code. Laravel's migration system provides a simple and intuitive way to create and manage database migrations, allowing you to version control your database schema and collaborate with other developers. With Eloquent, you can easily define your database schema using PHP code and create, update, or delete tables and columns as needed.

Query builder: Eloquent provides a powerful query builder that allows you to construct complex SQL queries using a simple and intuitive API. This query builder is designed to be easy to use and efficient, making it an ideal choice for developers who need to interact with databases frequently. With Eloquent's query builder, you can easily build complex queries, filter, sort, and paginate data, and execute raw SQL queries when needed.

Relationships: Eloquent provides a simple and powerful way to define relationships between database tables. You can define a wide range of relationships between tables, including one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and polymorphic relationships. With Eloquent's relationship system, you can easily query related data, create complex data structures, and optimize database performance.

Mass assignment protection: Mass assignment is a common security vulnerability in web applications, where an attacker can set certain properties of a model using form data. Eloquent provides a simple and secure way to protect against mass assignment vulnerabilities in your application. With Eloquent's mass assignment protection, you can specify which properties of a model can be set using mass assignment, and which cannot.

Soft deleting: Soft deleting is a convenient feature of Eloquent that allows you to mark records as "deleted" without actually deleting them from the database. This makes it easy to recover deleted records, perform audits on your data, or simply keep a record of deleted data. With soft deleting, you can easily restore deleted records or permanently delete them from the database as needed.

Events and observers: Eloquent provides a powerful system for handling database events and observers. With events and observers, you can perform complex operations on your data based on events that occur in your application. For example, you can send notifications when a record is created, update related records when a record is deleted, or perform other custom operations on your data based on your application's requirements.

Overall, Eloquent ORM is a powerful and flexible database management system that is designed to work seamlessly with Laravel's MVC architecture.
